# offline-data-collection-ios

This sample demonstrated at the 2012 Developer Summit can show you how you can build a complete, custom application that allows users to perform routing, use a custom tpk as an offline basemap and collect features when the device does not have network connectivity, and then synchronize those changes when connectivity is restored.  More information here [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=05eb7ea3dade445d8a86285d5c940a6a).
